## **1. Purpose**  
The purpose of this **Risk Assessment Methodology** is to define a structured approach for identifying, assessing, and managing information security risks related to [Company Name]’s **Microsoft Azure environment** used as a **landing zone for application development, deployment, and delivery to customers**.  

This methodology aligns with **ISO 27001:2022** and aims to ensure that risks to the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)** of cloud-based applications and infrastructure are systematically addressed.  

---

## **2. Scope**  
This methodology applies to:  
- All assets within the **Microsoft Azure tenant**, including virtual machines, databases, storage, networks, and security services.  
- **Software development processes**, including DevSecOps and CI/CD pipelines.  
- **Access management** and cloud identity controls (e.g., Azure Active Directory, MFA, RBAC).  
- **Data protection measures** within Azure-hosted applications.  
- **Third-party integrations** that interact with the cloud environment.  

This methodology **excludes** security risks related to customer-controlled environments and end-user devices.  

---

## **3. Risk Assessment Process**  
The risk assessment process follows a **systematic approach** based on **ISO 27005** and includes the following steps:  

### **Step 1: Asset Identification**  
Identify all information assets within the **Azure cloud environment**, including:  
- **Infrastructure assets** (e.g., virtual machines, databases, storage accounts).  
- **Applications and services** (e.g., web applications, APIs, microservices).  
- **Data assets** (e.g., customer data, configuration files, access logs).  
- **Human assets** (e.g., Azure administrators, DevOps engineers).

### **Step 2: Threat Identification**  
Identify **potential threats** that could impact the Azure environment. These may include:  

| **Threat Category**       | **Examples** |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Cyber Threats**         | Phishing, ransomware, DDoS attacks |
| **Cloud Misconfigurations** | Open storage accounts, excessive permissions |
| **Data Breaches**         | Unauthorized access, insider threats |
| **System Failures**       | Cloud service outages, software bugs |
| **Regulatory Compliance Risks** | Non-compliance with GDPR, ISO 27001 |
| **Third-Party Risks**      | Vendor security weaknesses, API vulnerabilities |

**Deliverable:** Threat List  

---

### **Step 3: Vulnerability Identification**  
Identify **vulnerabilities** within Azure-hosted applications and services that could be exploited by threats. Common vulnerabilities include:  

- **Weak IAM policies** (e.g., lack of MFA, excessive permissions).  
- **Unpatched software** (e.g., outdated virtual machine images, vulnerable libraries).  
- **Misconfigured security settings** (e.g., public storage buckets, open ports).  
- **Weak encryption practices** (e.g., plaintext storage of credentials).  

**Deliverable:** Vulnerability Register

### **Step 4: Risk Assessment**  
Each identified risk is assessed based on:  

#### **4.1 Risk Likelihood (L)**
Defines how likely a risk is to occur:  

| **Likelihood Score** | **Description** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **1 - Rare**        | Unlikely to happen but possible |
| **2 - Unlikely**    | Could happen but not expected |
| **3 - Possible**    | May occur under certain conditions |
| **4 - Likely**      | Expected to occur at some point |
| **5 - Almost Certain** | Highly probable and recurring |

#### **4.2 Risk Impact (I)**
Defines the potential impact if the risk occurs:  

| **Impact Score** | **Description** |
|------------------|----------------|
| **1 - Insignificant** | Minimal impact, easily recoverable |
| **2 - Minor** | Some effect, but operations continue |
| **3 - Moderate** | Noticeable disruption, partial downtime |
| **4 - Major** | Significant business impact |
| **5 - Critical** | Severe financial or reputational damage |

#### **4.3 Risk Calculation**
Risk is calculated using the formula:  

**Risk Score = Likelihood (L) × Impact (I)**  

| **Risk Score** | **Risk Level** | **Response** |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| **1 - 4**    | Low           | Accept or mitigate |
| **5 - 9**    | Medium        | Mitigate with controls |
| **10 - 15**  | High          | Immediate mitigation required |
| **16 - 25**  | Critical      | Escalate to senior management |

### **Step 5: Risk Treatment**  
Each identified risk will be treated using one of the following approaches:  

| **Treatment Option** | **Description** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Accept**          | If the risk is low and cost of mitigation outweighs impact |
| **Mitigate**        | Implement security controls to reduce likelihood or impact |
| **Transfer**        | Shift the risk (e.g., using cybersecurity insurance) |
| **Avoid**           | Stop activities that introduce high risk |

**Example Risk Treatment Plan:**  

| **Risk** | **Risk Level** | **Mitigation Strategy** |
|----------|--------------|------------------------|
| Unpatched VM vulnerabilities | High (12) | Implement auto-patching and vulnerability scanning |
| Excessive IAM permissions | Critical (20) | Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) |
| Unencrypted customer data | Critical (25) | Mandate encryption for data at rest and in transit |

### **Step 6: Continuous Monitoring & Review**  
- Risks will be reviewed **quarterly** or upon significant changes in Azure infrastructure.  
- Security controls will be tested through **penetration testing and security audits**.  
- Azure **Security Center, Sentinel, and SIEM logs** will be used for real-time monitoring.
