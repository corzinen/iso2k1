## **1. Purpose**  
The purpose of this **Information Security Policy** is to establish a framework for managing information security within [Company Name]. This policy ensures that security risks associated with the **Microsoft Azure tenant**—used as a **landing zone for the development, deployment, and delivery of company-developed applications to customers**—are effectively managed in compliance with **ISO 27001** and other relevant regulatory requirements.  

---

## **2. Scope**  
This policy applies to:  
- All **information systems, applications, and services** hosted within the **Microsoft Azure** environment.  
- All **employees, contractors, and third parties** who access or manage the Azure environment.  
- All **customer and company data** stored, processed, or transmitted within the Azure tenant.  

This policy covers all aspects of **cloud security, data protection, identity management, software development, and compliance** for cloud-hosted applications.

## **3. Information Security Objectives**  
To ensure the security of applications and data within Azure, [Company Name] commits to the following objectives:  

1. **Protect the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of Information** within the Azure cloud.

3. **Implement a risk-based approach** to manage security threats in Azure-hosted environments.  
4. **Maintain secure software development practices** throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
5. **Monitor and respond to security incidents** affecting cloud applications and infrastructure.  

---

## **4. Information Security Principles**  
To achieve these objectives, the following principles apply:  

- **Risk-Based Approach:** Security controls in Azure must be implemented based on identified risks.  
- **Least Privilege Access:** Access to Azure resources must be **limited** to only those who require it.  
- **Encryption by Default:** All data stored or transmitted in Azure must be encrypted using **industry-standard cryptographic methods**.  
- **Secure Development Practices:** Applications deployed in Azure must follow **secure coding guidelines** and undergo **security testing**.  
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Security logs and events must be monitored for **unauthorized access, threats, and vulnerabilities**.

## **5. Security Policies and Controls**  

### **5.1 Access Control**  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** must be enforced for all Azure administrators.  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** must be used to restrict access to cloud services.

### **5.2 Data Protection & Privacy**  
- Data **must be classified** based on sensitivity (e.g., public, internal, confidential, restricted).  
- Sensitive data must be **encrypted at rest and in transit**.  
- Personal data must be processed in accordance with **GDPR and applicable privacy laws**.  

### **5.3 Secure Software Development**  
- Developers must adhere to **secure coding practices** such as **OWASP Top 10**.  
- Security testing (static/dynamic analysis, penetration testing) must be conducted before deployment.  
- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) must be used to enforce security baselines in Azure.  

### **5.4 Vulnerability Management**  
- **Regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests** must be conducted on Azure-hosted applications.  
- Security patches must be **applied promptly** to all cloud-based systems.  
- **Azure Security Center** must be used for continuous risk assessment.  

### **5.5 Logging & Monitoring**  
- **Azure Monitor, Sentinel, and Log Analytics** must be used to track security events.  
- All security logs must be **retained** for at least [X months] for audit purposes.  
- Automated alerts must be configured for **critical security incidents**.  

### **5.6 Incident Response**  
- A **Cloud Security Incident Response Plan** must be in place to handle breaches.  
- Security incidents must be **reported, investigated, and remediated** within [X] hours.  
- Incident logs must be maintained for forensic analysis.  

---

## **6. Compliance & Auditing**  
- **Annual security audits** must be conducted to ensure adherence to **ISO 27001**.  
- Internal and external audits must verify compliance with security policies.  
- Employees must undergo **security awareness training** annually.
