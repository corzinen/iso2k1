## **1. Purpose**  
The **Risk Treatment Plan (RTP)** outlines how [Company Name] will mitigate identified security risks within its **Microsoft Azure environment**, used as a **landing zone for software development, deployment, and customer delivery**. This plan aligns with the **ISO 27001:2022** framework and ensures that security threats to cloud-hosted assets are managed effectively.  

---

## **2. Scope**  
This Risk Treatment Plan applies to:  

- **Azure-hosted infrastructure** (virtual machines, databases, storage, networking).  
- **Software development processes** (DevSecOps, CI/CD pipelines).  
- **Cloud security controls** (IAM, logging, encryption).  
- **Data protection and regulatory compliance** (ISO 27001, GDPR, industry best practices).  

Excluded: Risks related to customer-managed environments and end-user devices.  

---

## **3. Risk Treatment Process**  
Each identified risk is categorized based on **likelihood and impact** (as per the **Risk Assessment Methodology**). Risks are then addressed using one of the following treatment options:  

- **Accept:** No further action required (low risks).  
- **Mitigate:** Implement security controls to reduce risk likelihood or impact.  
- **Transfer:** Shift risk to a third party (e.g., cybersecurity insurance, cloud provider responsibility).  
- **Avoid:** Discontinue activities introducing high risk.
